# Product Requirements Document: Order Processing Integration

**Prepared For:** E-Commerce Platform – Engineering Teams

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the **Sales** and **Delivery** systems to support a full order lifecycle within a large-scale e-commerce platform. Each department operates its own system, and this initiative aims to implement a reliable and robust communication flow between them.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Allow the Sales department to receive and process customer orders.
- Ensure product availability before confirming orders.
- Store and track order information across its lifecycle.
- Initiate delivery workflows upon order creation.
- Receive delivery status updates to keep order states synchronized.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Order Creation (Sales Application)

- Sales exposes a **secure API endpoint** to receive incoming customer orders.
- When an order is received:
  1. Validate input data.
  2. Check product availability.
  3. If available:
     - Create the order in the Sales database.
     - Assign a **unique order ID**.
     - Set the order status to **“Pending Shipment”**.
     - Initiate the delivery process.
     - Return the order ID to the customer.

### 3.2 Communication Between Systems

- Upon order creation, the Sales application must communicate with other systems regarding new order details.
- The Delivery application begins the shipment processing once it receives order details.

### 3.3 Delivery Notifications (Delivery → Sales)

- The Delivery application sends updates to the Sales system:
  - When the order is **shipped**.
  - When the order is **delivered**.
- These updates should update the order status in the Sales system accordingly (**“Shipped”** and **“Delivered”**).

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Mandatory

- **Reliability:** Communication between services must tolerate transient failures and ensure eventual consistency.
- **Scalability:** The system must support high throughput during peak ordering hours.

### 4.2 Nice-to-Have

- **Idempotency:** Status updates and event handling must be designed to handle duplicate messages safely.
- **Security:** All APIs and messages must be securely authenticated and authorized.
- **Observability:** Systems should log key events and expose metrics for monitoring flow health.

---

## 5. Out of Scope

- Payment handling and validation.
- Inventory reservation or warehouse logistics.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

- All valid orders receive a confirmed order ID.
- Order delivery status changes are reflected in the Sales system reliably and promptly.
- Delivery status changes are reflected in the Delivery system reliably and promptly.
